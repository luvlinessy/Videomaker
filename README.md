# Videomaker
In this project I used the **moviepy** module. It is used for video editing.

Before creating this project, I had no idea that it was possible to use a Python library to interact with video in any way. My project proved the opposite, it can make photo slideshows that are full-fledged videos. 

You can add your own photos and get interesting results.
